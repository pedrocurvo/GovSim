At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars. Each fisherman's goal is to optimize his income in the long run over many months. At the end of each month, the number of fish caught by each fisherman will be revealed, and the fishermen will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 tons of fish at the beginning of the month and the five fishermen catch a total of 30 fish, there will be 60 tons of fish left at the end of the month before reproduction, and 100 tons after reproduction.\nLocation: lake\nDate: 2024-03-01\n\nKey memories of Luke (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: From my perspective, it seems like John, who initially caught nothing, is now catching 2024-01-30 tons of fish, which is significantly higher than the initial 0 tons\n- 2024-01-30: The community agreed on a maximum limit of 0 tons of fish per person.\n- 2024-01-31: The community's agreement on a maximum limit of 0 tons per person indicates a willingness to consider sustainable practices and possibly reduce overall fishing pressure, which could lead to better resource management and reduced environmental impacts.\n- 2024-01-31: Optimizing fishing strategies is crucial for maximizing income in the long term due to the potential for increased catches leading to higher yields and greater economic benefits.\n- 2024-02-28: The community agreed on a maximum limit of 0 tons of fish per person.\n- 2024-02-29: The community agreed on a maximum limit of 0 tons of fish per person, indicating a willingness to consider sustainable practices and possibly reduce overall fishing pressure, which could lead to better resource management and reduced environmental impacts.\n- 2024-02-29: Optimizing fishing strategies is crucial for maximizing income in the long term due to the potential for increased catches leading to higher yields and greater economic benefits.\n- 2024-02-29: The community's agreement on a maximum limit of 0 tons per person indicates a willingness to consider sustainable practices and possibly reduce overall fishing pressure, which could lead to better resource management and reduced environmental impacts.\n- 2024-02-29: Optimization of fishing strategies is essential for maximizing income in the long run, given the potential for increased catches leading to higher yields and greater economic benefits.\n- 2024-03-01: Before everyone fishes, there are 100 tons of fish in the lake.\n\n\nTask: With a fishing range set between 0-100, how many tons of fish would you catch this month?
