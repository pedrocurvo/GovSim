If the other four fishermen catch 100 tons, that leaves 0 tons for me. After reproduction, the lake's population will double, and there will be 200 tons of fish.

What do you all think about this?\n-Luke: I think Emma's proposal of aiming for 2.5 tons per person is a good compromise, and I'm comfortable with this target. I'd like to add that we should also consider setting a minimum and maximum catch limit for each fisherman to ensure we're all on the same page and to avoid any misunderstandings. For example, we could set a minimum of 1.5 tons and a maximum of 3.5 tons to give us some flexibility while still maintaining the lake's sustainability.

John caught 2 tons of fish. Kate caught 1 tons of fish. Jack caught 3 tons of fish. Emma caught 5 tons of fish. Luke caught 3 tons of fish. \n-John: Hey everyone, thanks for the update. I'm glad to see we're all being mindful of the lake's population. I was thinking that since we're all aware of the carrying capacity and the reproduction rate, maybe we can discuss a more strategic approach to our fishing. Perhaps we can aim for a more balanced catch, with each of us targeting a specific range of fish to ensure the lake's sustainability. What do you all think?\n-Kate: I think John's idea is a great starting point. I was thinking of aiming for a range of 2-3 tons of fish per month, as we discussed earlier. It's a good balance between earning a decent income and ensuring the lake's sustainability. What do you all think about this range? Should we set a target of 2-3 tons for the next month?\n-Emma: I think Kate's suggestion of aiming for 2-3 tons of fish per month is a great idea. I was thinking of aiming for a slightly higher range, around 3-4 tons, but I'm open to adjusting my strategy to ensure the lake's sustainability. I'd like to hear from Jack and Luke, what are your thoughts on this proposal?\n-Jack: I think Kate's suggestion of aiming for 2-3 tons of fish per month is a good starting point. I was thinking of aiming for a slightly lower range, around 2-2.5 tons, to be on the cautious side and ensure the lake's sustainability. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on the group's consensus. I'd like to hear from Luke, what are your thoughts on this proposal?\n-Luke: I think Kate's suggestion of aiming for 2-3 tons of fish per month is a good starting point, and I'm comfortable with that range. I was thinking of aiming for the lower end of that range, around 2 tons, to be on the cautious side and ensure the lake's sustainability. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on the group's consensus. I'd like to hear from everyone, but I think we're getting close to a consensus.\n-Emma: I think we're getting close to a consensus, and I'm comfortable with aiming for the 2-3 tons range as well. I'd like to propose that we set a specific target of 2.5 tons per person for the next month, which would put our total catch at 12.5 tons. This would allow us to earn a decent income while still ensuring the lake's sustainability. What do you all think about this proposal?\n-Kate: I think Emma's proposal of aiming for 2.5 tons per person is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than my initial suggestion of 2-3 tons, but it's still a reasonable target that balances income and sustainability. I'm comfortable with this proposal, and I think it's a good starting point for our next month's fishing. What do you all think about setting a target of 2.5 tons per person for the next month?\n-Jack: I think Emma's proposal of aiming for 2.5 tons per person is a good compromise, and I'm comfortable with this target. I'd like to add that we should also consider the possibility of adjusting our strategy if the lake's population changes significantly over the next month. We should be prepared to adapt our approach if necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the lake's population.
