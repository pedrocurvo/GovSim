I've been using reusable bags and containers for my groceries and personal items, and I've also been making sure to recycle as much as possible. It's surprising how much of a difference it can make.

I've actually been meaning to switch to reusable straws and water bottles for a while now. It's great to hear that it can make a big difference in reducing trash.
