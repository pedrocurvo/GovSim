I think we could benefit from a few changes. First, maybe we can establish a rotating system where each of us takes out a slightly higher amount one month and a lower amount the next. This way, no one feels overwhelmed with the task every month. Additionally, we could set up a shared calendar to remind us when it's our turn to take out the trash.

A rotating system sounds like a fair way to distribute the responsibility. I'm also in favor of using a shared calendar to keep track of whose turn it is. As for the tracking system, I think it's a good idea too. It will help us see our progress and make necessary adjustments. I'll start by setting up a Google Calendar reminder for the first week of each month to remind us all. \n\nAdditionally, I propose we aim for a consistent 13 units per person as a target, and if we exceed that, we can discuss adjusting our contributions in the following month. This way, we can ensure we're not overloading anyone and staying within the limits.\n\nWhat do you guys think about starting with these proposals?"], ["Jack", "Sounds like a solid plan, Kate. I agree that a rotating system and a shared calendar will help us manage the task more efficiently.
